#Setup

I wrote this as a personal setup script for my Mac. You might find it useful too.

It installs a number of useful utilities by default but can also install some more specialized items if required. Please look over the code to see what it installs fully, but here are a few things it can do: 

*Installs Homebrew and a few good repos or updates and cleans it up if it's already installed
*Sets up Python and Pip on a fresh system
*Installs Nodejs and a number of really good CLI tools
*Installs Mackup and restores configs if they exist
*Symlinks iCloud Drive for easier access from the CLI
*"Patches" Gatekeeper so you can install software from anywhere on El Capitan or higher systems
*Properly sets up Metasploit and SET so they are immediately useable with an alias
